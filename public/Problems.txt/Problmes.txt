Error: Failed to resolve import "@/components/" from "src/test/ProductTable.test.js". Does the file exist?
Answer=> 1. Simplifies Import Paths
Using an alias like @ allows you to simplify import paths in your code. Without an alias, you would have to use relative paths, which can become cumbersome and error-prone as your project grows:

Without Alias: import ProductTable from '../../components/ProductTable.vue';
With Alias: import ProductTable from '@/components/ProductTable.vue';
